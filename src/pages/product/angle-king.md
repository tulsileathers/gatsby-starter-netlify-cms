Angle King is an original take on the concept of an underspin.  Not only does it have twin inline blades designed to flash and clack but it sports three line ties so you can get a new angle on the fish with ease.  What this does is open up a wider variety of retrieve speeds and make it a more versatile lure than any single-tie, single spinner underspin.
