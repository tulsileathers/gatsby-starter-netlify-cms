if you want a rose, you must respect its thorns"

the rose offers us a powerful lesson into the nature of interpersonal boundaries. its flower is soft, intricate, & delicate; yet it possesses thorns which demand our respect. so, like the rose, for us to fully unfurl our flower hearts, it is essential we establish our boundaries. this anointing oil helps us hold open-hearted space for others while respecting our thorns so as to not take on any emotions that do not serve us. it's especially helpful for empaths or those who internalize their environments in ways that leave them feeling drained. by respecting our thorns, we come to be more fully present with others & stand in our true, compassionate integrity.

the magick within: love, intention, rose & hawthorn-infused jojoba oil, essential oils of rose & sacred resins, programmed herkimer diamonds, rose petals, a yarrow leaf, & a single hawthorn thorn. all organic or ethically wildcrafted/mined. reiki-charged.
