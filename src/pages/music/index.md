Jordann's debut EP Book of Changes is available on [Bandcamp](https://jordannfunk.bandcamp.com/)

>In the woods behind her home, Jordann recorded these songs as she created them in improvisational flow, guided by poetry she'd written inspired by the divinatory text, the I-Ching (aka the Book of Changes). You can hear the immediacy of emotions felt in her voice, the spiritual wisdom of this ancient text in her lyrics, and the chorus of birdsong surrounding her. While the recordings are not professional, this compilation strikes a chord of humanness that draws you in no matter what. The Book of Changes was recorded on May 23rd, 2015.
