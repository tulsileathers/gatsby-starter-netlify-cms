Sensitive Earth Healing Arts serves as the vehicle for Jordann's work as a multi-modal healer. As a teenager, Jordann began to intuit her innate capacities for energy healing, and so she began studying Reiki and guiding mindfulness meditation. By age 21, she traveled to India where she earned her Reiki Master Certification through an intensive program that merged Usui & Karuna techniques and also taught the dynamics of Stone & Crystal Healing. Upon return to the States, Jordann then completed another Reiki Masters in the lineage of Diane Stein to add more breadth & depth to her studies. It was then that she graduated from Vassar College with a degree in Cognitive Science and Religious Studies.
Since she was a child, Jordann has experienced a sincerely deep connection to the Earth, leading her to observe & learn the healing powers the natural world offers. In 2013, Jordann began to pursue studies in Plant Medicine and in the summer of 2017 became certified in the Fundamentals of Herbal Medicine through an intensive program at the Applachia School of Holistic Herbalism. Currently, she studies clinical herbalism at the Evolutionary School of Herbal Medicine & the Clearpath School of Herbal Medicine. Jordann largely focuses on the practice of Intuitive Plant Medicine, which acknowledges the Earth as sentient and honors the innate knowledge humans possess to heal themselves when in relationship and conversation with the Earth. Acknowledging the Earth as sensitive is also a focal point in Jordann's music as a singer-songwriter. She is currently working on composing her first full-length album.
