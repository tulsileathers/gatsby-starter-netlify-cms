title: 'About Jordann'
---

After intuiting her innate healing abilities, Jordann became a certified Reiki Master and Crystal Healer in 2015. She studied intensively in India with Usha Dobhal (ranked World's Best Reiki Master in 2016). Jordann has been immersed in the formal studies of Plant Medicine and Botany since 2013, though her deep connection with plants dates back to her childhood in the rural Appalachian foothills. She also has degrees in Religious Studies and Cognitive Science with a focus on Mindfulness Meditation from Vassar College, which further rounds out her knowledge as a healing artist.
