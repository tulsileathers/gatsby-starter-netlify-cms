# Earth Energy Healing
Earth Energy healing sessions include the modalities of Reiki and stone, sound, and plant medicine. Sessions normally last an hour, and they are held underneath a copper pyramid to raise the vibration of the healing. Jordann will read and clear your energy field, and then use Reiki, stones, sound, and plant remedies to bring you into a deep state of relaxation and balance. This unique method amplifies your specific healing process.
# Herbal Consultations
Sensitive Earth also offers herbal consultations. In these sessions, you and Jordann will engage deeply in conversation about what you seek to heal, and then you will drop into meditation where Jordann will read your pulse and energy field. After connecting, she will offer plant and vibrational remedies that are in alignment for you. These entail potent, custom remedies that Jordann prepares with you in heart.
